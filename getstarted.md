# Getting Started with ApexNode

*This will be an extensive guide on how to get started with using ApexNode.host*

## Step 1. Choosing the game

Like many hosts, we have a list of games to choose from.

| Game            |
|:--------------- |
| Minecraft       |
| Project Zomboid |
| PalWorld        |
| Terraria        |
| BeamNg (BeamMP) |
| Satisfactory    |
| Necesse         |
| Vintage Story   |

You can change the active game server to any other game server that we offer quickly and easily from our game panel. Learn more by [clicking here](panel/changegame).

From this list you may pick any game you want hosted from us.
Additionally, we have many other games that we may host but we won't generally provide priority support for.

## Step 2. Choose your plan

Choosing the right budget for your budget and server size is important.

While we don't put any limits on your server's player slots, some games may scale active players with RAM differently than others.

Some things to remember. The plan you choose adjusts the RAM, Storage, Backup Slots, and sometimes the cores. You can upgrade your plan at any time via your [client service area].
