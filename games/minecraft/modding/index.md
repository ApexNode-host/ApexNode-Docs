# Minecraft Server Modding Installation Guide

### Downloading Mods

{: .warning}
The following guide is intended for Minecraft servers running Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge. Vanilla Minecraft servers, Bedrock servers, and most other non-modded Minecraft servers won't be able to handle Minecraft server mods.

{: .success}
We recommened downloading mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods), or [CurseForge](www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/).

Regardless of where you download mods from only download mods from authors and sources you trust. Downloading and installing mods from untrusted sources can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Installing Mods

{: .warning}
Installing mods from untrusted/unknown sources can lead to security vulnerabilities.

{: .warning}
Some mods may require specific versions of Minecraft. Only install Minecraft mods that have been confirmed by the author to work for your Minecraft server's version.

Installing a Minecraft server mod is relatively simply and straightforward for the most-part. However depending on the mod you're installing, there may be additional steps you need to take. Be sure to check with the install guide for the mod it where needed. 

Likewise, some mods may be dependent on other mods being installed alongside it, so always check the mod dependencies as well.

*Below are the most common steps for installing a mod.*

1. Download the mod to your computer.
2. Login to our game panel.
3. Select your Minecraft server.
4. In the side menu, click the **Files** tab.
5. Click to open the mods folder. `If you don't see a mods folder, create one.`
6. Upload your mod .jar file inside your mods folder. `If you're mod is in a .zip file, upload the .zip file to the mods folder and unarchive the .zip file, making sure the mod .jar file is in the mods folder.`
7. Finally restart your Minecraft server and the mod should be ready to use!
