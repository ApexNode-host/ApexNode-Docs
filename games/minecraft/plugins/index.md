# Minecraft Server Plugin Installation Guide

### Downloading Plugins

{: .warning}
The following guide is intended for Minecraft servers running Java Spigot. Vanilla Minecraft servers, Bedrock servers, and most modded Minecraft servers won't be able to handle Minecraft server plugins.

{: .success}
We recommened downloading plugins from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugins), or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&pageSize=20&sortBy=relevancy&class=bukkit-plugins).

Regardless of where you download plugins from only download plugins from authors and sources you trust. Downloading and installing plugins from untrusted sources can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Installing Plugins

{: .warning}
Installing plugins from untrusted/unknown sources can lead to security vulnerabilities.

{: .warning}
Some plugins may require specific versions of Minecraft. Only install Minecraft plugins that have been confirmed by the author to work for your Minecraft server's version.

Installing a Minecraft server plugin is relatively simply and straightforward for the most-part. However depending on the plugin you're installing, there may be additional steps you need to take. Be sure to check with the plugin's guide for installing it where needed.

Likewise, some plugins may be dependent on other plugins being installed alongside it, so always check the plugin dependencies as well.

*Below are the most common steps for installing a plugin.*

1. Download the plugin to your computer.
2. Login to our game panel.
3. Select your Minecraft server.
4. In the side menu, click the **Files** tab.
5. Click to open the plugins folder. `If you don't see a plugins folder, create one.`
6. Upload your plugin .jar file inside your plugins folder. `If you're plugin is in a .zip file, upload the .zip file to the plugins folder and unarchive the .zip file, making sure the plugin .jar file is in the plugins folder.`
7. Finally restart your Minecraft server and the plugin should be ready to use!
