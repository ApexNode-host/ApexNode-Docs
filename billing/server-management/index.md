# Server Management Guide

## Understanding our Server Management Addon

{: .warning}
**Note:** The Server Management Addon is only available for servers with **12GB RAM or higher**.

The Server Management Addon is designed for server owners who want a more hands-off experience. Whether you're running a modded Minecraft server or a complex configuration for another game, our tiers of management give you flexibility and peace of mind.

---

## Tiers

### Self Managed (Free)
You’re fully responsible for configuring, and maintaining your server.

While we don’t set things up or optimize the server for you, we’ll assist with questions, errors, and general troubleshooting via our normal support channels (tickets or Discord).

---

### Basic Management ($25 / one-time setup fee)
Recommended for users who need help **getting started** but plan to manage the server afterward.

**Includes:**
- One-time setup of a modpack or custom plugin configuration
- Installation of all provided files (mods, plugins, configs)
- Basic optimization (startup flags, minor tweaks)
- Server startup validation

**Requirements:**
- All required files must be provided **in bulk** before setup begins.
- Further changes or ongoing support are not included.

---

### Premium Management ($75 / month)
For those who want a **fully managed experience** — we handle setup, maintenance, and regular updates so you can focus on your community.

**Includes:**
- Everything in Basic Management
- Ongoing plugin/mod support and configuration
- Assistance with player issues (e.g., stuck chunks, lag reports)
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Crash report analysis and resolution
- Scheduled server maintenance on request
- Discord-based support with faster response times

**Does NOT include:**
- Development of custom plugins or mods
- Constant monitoring for uptime (we are not a 24/7 NOC)

---

## Use Cases

- **Self Managed**: Great for developers or experienced server owners who prefer total control.
- **Basic Management**: Ideal for new server owners who need help with the initial setup but want to handle daily maintenance themselves.
- **Premium Management**: Best for community leaders, creators, or streamers who want their server professionally managed and maintained.

---
