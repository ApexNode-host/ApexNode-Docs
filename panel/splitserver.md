# How to split your game server

You can split the active game server into multiple game servers that we offer quickly and easily from our game panel. Simply follow our steps below.

The server splitter feature is currently only available for our Extreme tiered game servers. As of 03/12/2025 Extreme plans are not available.

### Step 1. Login to our [game panel](https://panel.apexnode.host)

### Step 2. Select the game server you'd like to split

### Step 3. Click the "More" button in the menu and click "Splitter"
Now you should see the total stats and resources reserved for your main game server.

### Step 4. Click the "+" button to add a new split game server

### Step 5. Fill in the information for the new split server
This will take resources you enter from your main server and allocate them to the new split server.

### Step 6. Click the "Split Server" button

Now just wait for the new split game server to install and you're ready!

From here it's up to you what to do, if you plan on hosting the same game then you're good to go. 
If you plan on hosting a different game, then you can change the new split server to any game that we offer. You can use our guide on how to do that by [clicking here](changegame).
