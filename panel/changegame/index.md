# How to change your game server

You can change the active game server to any other game server that we offer quickly and easily from our game panel. Simply follow our steps below.

### Step 1. Login to our [game panel](https://panel.apexnode.host)

### Step 2. Select the game server you'd like to change

### Step 3. Click the "Settings" tab

### Step 4. In the Change Egg config section, click the drop down.

### Step 5. Select the game you wish to change the server to and click Apply

We offer many games through our change game feature, many of which we may not provide priority support for. You may still switch to them at any point.

{: .warning}
Some games may require more RAM or Storage than your active game server offers. Upgrading to a suitable plan may be required depending on the game you choose.

### (Optional) Step 5. Delete server files

If you'd like to delete the server files for the game server you're changing from, click the "Wipe Server Files" button. Warning, this option is irreversible.

### Step 6. Click the "Change Egg" button

Now just wait for the game server to install the new game you've chosen and you're ready!
